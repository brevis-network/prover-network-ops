# How to request proof

Use [explorer BrevisMarket](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x7c968e3b1FaE6599958104cbf40d17A4ba0c1d43#writeProxyContract) to request proof. Follow below instructions to obtain each param of a request.

1. `nonce`

A unique num to identify a request from you

2. `vk`

A VK digest is generated by the build ELF file. It could be generated by using [pico-proving-service gen-app-id](https://github.com/brevis-network/pico-proving-service?tab=readme-ov-file#generate-application-id-locally):
```
# clone the enter pico-proving-service repository
cd pico-proving-service
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -r --bin gen-app-id -- --elf ELF_FILE_PATH
```

3. `publicValuesDigest`

A public values digest is generated by the build ELF file and input data. It could be generated by using [pico-proving-service gen-pv-digest](https://github.com/brevis-network/pico-proving-service?tab=readme-ov-file#generate-public-values-digest-locally):
```
# clone the enter pico-proving-service repository
cd pico-proving-service
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -r --bin gen-pv-digest -- --elf ELF_FILE_PATH --inputs INPUT_FILE_PATH
```

4. `imgURL`

Reference the [Pico document](https://pico-docs.brevis.network/writing-apps/programs) to write a application program. Then use `cargo pico build` to compile and generate the ELF. 
Reference [Pico Fibonacci](https://github.com/brevis-network/pico/tree/main/perf/bench_apps/fibonacci) as an example. 
The generated ELF file is uploaded to this URL.

5. `inputData`

The input data is build by the pico-sdk emulator builder. Reference [pico-proving-service gen-inputs](https://github.com/brevis-network/pico-proving-service/blob/main/bin/gen_inputs.rs):
```
# clone the enter pico-proving-service repository
cd pico-proving-service

# update `gen_inputs.rs` to write the input data as the ELF code required
# for example, the Fibonacci ELF only `read` an u32, you could write an u32 without other inputs
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -r --bin gen-inputs
```

6. `inputURL`

The input data is uploaded to this URL if it's large. 
It's optional, either `inputData` or `inputURL` should be provided.

7. `fee`

In tuple [`maxFee`, `minStake`, `deadline`].
`maxFee`, the max fee in staking token (for testnet, it's [testnet staking token](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x46b07178907650afc855763a8f83e65afec24074)) you wish to pay for the request.
`minStake`, only the provers that stake more than the value can bid for the request.
`deadline`, the proof should be submitted no later than.

Note, Before initiate a proof request, you need to use [explorer StakingToken](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x46b07178907650afc855763a8f83e65afec24074#writeContract) to approve `BrevisMarket` 0x7c968e3b1FaE6599958104cbf40d17A4ba0c1d43 to spend your staking token.

Please contact Brevis team for the faucet of the staking token.
