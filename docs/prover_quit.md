# How to quit ProverNet as a prover

Quit ProverNet is simple that it only takes two steps:

1. [Unstake](./tools.md#unstake). Note that unstaking has two stages - request stage, and then after a delay peirod set in `StakingController` contract, complete stage
2. [Claim commission](./tools.md#claim-commission)

Note that the config.toml template used in the CLI utility tools locates at `./tools/config.toml` for Base Mainnet launch, and `./tools/beta/config.toml` for Base Beta launch.
